/*
Filename: ComplexProgram.js

This code is a complex program that simulates a virtual ecosystem where plants and animals exist. It demonstrates advanced concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in object-oriented programming. The ecosystem consists of different types of plants and animals, which interact with each other based on their characteristics and behaviors. The program has several helper functions and classes to represent the entities in the ecosystem.

Disclaimer: This code is a demonstration and not a complete working program. It may require additional implementation and refinement for practical use.
